# Virtual Keyboard for Divyangs

## Objective

The main objective of our project is to propose a useful BCI (Brain Computer Interface) that monitors the blinking pattern of the challenged users and converts these bioelectric signals and use them as appropriate commands to allow them to communicate. Implementation Requirements

## Inspiration

In everyday life, we often do not think about how differently-abled people live, what problems they have to face. And the point here is not so much in spiritual insensitivity as in the fact that there are very few points of contact between people with disabilities and society.


## Project Design

Virtual Keyboard is just another example of today’s computer trend of ‘smaller and faster’. Computing is now not limited to desktops and laptops, it has found its way into mobile devices like palmtops and even cell phones. But what has not changed for the last 50 or so odd years is the input device, the good old QWERTY keyboard and the virtual keyboard technology is latest development.
The new virtual keyboard technology uses sensor technology, artificial intelligence and in our project it is just a human eye controlling the words to let users work on any surface as if it were a keyboard. Our project consists of a program which provides you a keyboard on the monitor. A physically challenged person can use his/her eye to write the words on the monitor. A blink of the left eye will lead you towards the left portion of the keyboard and a blink of the right eye will lead towards the right side of the keyboard. Further the blink of both the eyes will let you write the character on the monitor.


## The main features are: 

Platform-independent multilingual support for keyboard text input, built-in language layouts and settings etc. operations support just as in a regular text editor, already existing system language settings remain intact, easy and user-friendly interface and design, and small file size.
